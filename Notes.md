# Graph Notes:
  - Graphs are a way to quantify data.
    # Directed Graph:
      - One-way directions
    # Undirected Graph:
      - No directions or multiple directions


# Definitions:
  # arc:
    directed line (a pair of ordered vertices)
  # edge:
    line joining a pair of nodes
      ~ incident edges: edges that share a vertex, "A[n] edge and vertex are incident if the edge connects the vertex to another."
  # loop:
    edge or arc that joins a vertex to itself
  # vetex (node):
    a point (or circle), fundamental unit that make graphs
      ~ adjacent vertacies: connected by edge
      ~ degree: number of edges connected to said vertex (loops count twice)
      ~ predecessor/successor
